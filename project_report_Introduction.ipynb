    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "With the growing interest in the field of sports analytics, the NCAA Men's College Basketball Tournament offers a fertile ground for the application of predictive modeling, owing to its inherent unpredictability and the diverse range of participating teams.\n",

    "Hence, we aim to answer the following predictive question: \n",
    "\n",
    "> *Can we predict the POSTSEASON variable in our dataset based on our predictor variables?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will focus on the **seasons 2013-2019**,and **seasons2021-2023 combined**. The 2020 season's data set is kept separate from the other seasons, because there was no postseason due to the Coronavirus."
